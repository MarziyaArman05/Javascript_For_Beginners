1.The split() method is used to split a string into multiple 
sub - strings and return them in the form of an array.
A separator can be specified as a parameter so that the 
string is split whenever that separator is found in the string.The space character(” “) is specified
    in this parameter to separate the string whenever a
     space occurs.

     2.The join() method is used to join an array of strings
      using a separator. This will return a new string with 
      the joined string using the specified separator.
       This method is used on the returned array and no
        separator (“”) is used to join the strings.
         This will join the strings in the array and return a new 
     string. This will remove all the spaces in the original string. 



     3.map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.

map() calls a function once for each element in an array.

map() does not execute the function for empty elements.

map() does not change the original array.
